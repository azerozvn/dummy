    <p>Setting goals gives me a <strong>long-term</strong> and <strong>short-term</strong> motivation. It also gives me the <strong>confidence</strong> that I need to make <i>higher</i> and <i>more complicated</i> goals. By setting goals and constantly reminding myself of them, I feel as though I work hard to meet my goals. In order to succeed I believe <strong>setting goals is very important</strong>. Some of the goals that I have set for myself are that I want to play college softball, be able to inspire someone, and travel to new places. </p>
